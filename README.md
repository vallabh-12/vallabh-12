### üéì Currently working on my MSc Dissertation:

üß† Self-Supervised Learning for Early Cancer Detection
This project explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to detect early-stage cancer from unlabeled medical imaging data, including histopathology and CT scans. It investigates how models trained without annotations can learn rich visual representations, which are later fine-tuned on limited labeled samples for cancer classification.

The objective is to develop a scalable, low-label diagnostic framework that addresses real-world challenges in medical imaging ‚Äî such as limited expert annotations and data scarcity ‚Äî while maintaining accuracy and interpretability.
